 * Hint:
 * 
 * You can start with a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 7, which you can derive by making a few modifications 
 * the even number printing example given earlier in the chapter, where the for loop was introduced.
 * 
 * Now consider the equivalence between numbers and strings of hash characters. You can go from 1 to 2 by adding 1 (+= 1).
 * You can go from "#" to "##" by adding a character (+= "#"). Thus, your solution can closely follow the number-printing
 * program.
