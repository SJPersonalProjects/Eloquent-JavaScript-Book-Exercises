/**
 * 
 * Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
 * 
 * #
 * ##
 * ###
 * ####
 * #####
 * ######
 * #######
 * 
 * It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.
 * 
 * let abc = "abc";
 * console.log(abc.length);
 * // â†’ 3
 * 
 * 
 * Hint:
 * 
 * You can start with a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 7, which you can derive by making a few modifications 
 * the even number printing example given earlier in the chapter, where the for loop was introduced.
 * 
 * Now consider the equivalence between numbers and strings of hash characters. You can go from 1 to 2 by adding 1 (+= 1).
 * You can go from "#" to "##" by adding a character (+= "#"). Thus, your solution can closely follow the number-printing
 * program.

 *

 * divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
 * 
 * When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and
 * still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
 * 
 * (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer
 * candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)

 * is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form 
 * chessboard.
